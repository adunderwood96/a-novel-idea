# The Book Hangover Cure: Book Generator
A book generator that allows the reader to search a book that they are interested in or already read and get several related books as well. 
To add a little spice as a play on the website title, (and a personal interest) the reader is also provided with a random cocktail to try with the book they searched.

## User Story:
As a reader when I am interested in a book I like to add it to a list to keep track and
be able to find similar books to know what to read next

As an added bonus when searching, a drink to try while reading their chosen book! or to help cure the book hangover!

## Technologies:
- CSS Framework: Bulma
- Javascript framework: Jquery

### APIs: 
- Google Books: to search for book by title and get similar books
- CocktailDB: Provides a random drink for the reader to try with the book they searched
